All images have an associated json file with this basic information:

 * photo: the name/username of the photographer (on flickr)
 * source: The URL where I found the picture (a page on flickr)
 * license: The license, duh

I worked hard to make sure the information is correct, but I might have made errors, check the source to be sure.
